TODO:
draw and compare the acquired results
try integrating over smaller time to get displacement from gyro 
input -f: change imu coordinates to camera coordinates

incorporate acc info in imu displacement 
fix thresh issue: maybe write a new function for thresh  

get the kf model to work on new YOLO output
video sequence testing on kf
